Average temperature difference between the 2 months is not very significant despite being in different seasons. Business may be affected by the low temperature days in December, but the average temperature data shows that the amount of days with cold temperature should not greatly affect the business success. December and June have similar maximum temperatures in the 80s, ideal for both surfing and shakes. To delve further into this analysis, the average temperatures should be sorted by year and analyzed similarly to see if the yearly temperature trend is going up or down.  Additionally, it may be beneficial to look at the precipitation alongside the temperature to determine how often it rains during warm weather.
